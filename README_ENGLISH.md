- Non-clustered index
- Cursor usage and various triggers (AFTER, INSTEAD OF, BULK)

### 📗 DML (Data Manipulation Language)

- Insert, Update, Delete records
- SELECT queries with:
  - JOIN, WHERE, LIKE, IN
  - Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - GROUP BY, HAVING, ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS
  - Ranking functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE)
